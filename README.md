# Tidy data preparation course project

## R-script description and usage 
There are 3 sub-functions one to download and unzip files  
and 2 to generate 2 tidy datasets and main function that run all these functions.

### Main script  save data into text files
data_preparation_script <- function()
It is enough to run it without parameters to download activity data, get tidy data with grouped averages and save them into text file.

### Download zip archive into working directory and extract it
download_samsung_data <- function() 

### Load data from extracted files into datasets, prepare 2 tidy datasets and save them
run_analysis <- function() 
This function return dataset with all mean and standard deviation values. They has not beem grouped yet.

### Calculate average of all variables for each activity and each subject
averages_by_subject_and_activity <- function(tidy_activity_data_set)
This function take tidy dataset, generated by run_analysis and return grouped by activity and by subject averagres

### Write tidy data to text files
write_datasets <- function(mean_std_tidy_data , grouped_tidy_data)
The function just write data into files: "all_mean_std_tidy_data.txt", "grouped_mean_std_tidy_data.txt".

I tried to comment code in extensive manner. Please refer to run_analysis.R file to find more information.
